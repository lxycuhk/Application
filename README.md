# Application
The repository is created for review in application process

The three files: Shell Scripts.sh, IsFestival.Java and CalSubway_OD.pig are a serious of demo code of my current work

The aim of the project is to calculate attributes of Shenzhen subway passengers according to their tapped card records

Basically I write JAR to define functions and use shell script to direct and run the Pig Latin and use Pig Latin to calculate Attrbutes
It is just a part of the project on which I am still working


The R file is a part of my final project during undergraduate study. I tried to solve the log likelihood function of a Probit Model

The project is aimed to predict the winning chance of Hong Kong Horse Race, the code is trying to solve the likelihood function

In the model I applied Gaussian-Hermite Quadrature to simplify the likelihood function and use Newton-Raphson method to approximate the solution
